Display data from NASA API - https://api.nasa.gov/

# Description
This is a demo Android app written in Kotlin that uses an MVVM architecture, and uses the NASA API
to display data.
Below are the libraries used. Some are still in progress and may not be fully implemented.
Over time I will try to update the codebase to use more modern libraries and techniques.

# Libraries Used
- Compose
- AndroidX
- ViewModel
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Hilt

# ToDo
- Migrate to Compose
- Add tests
- Add more features?
